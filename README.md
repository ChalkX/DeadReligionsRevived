#Description
Dead Religions Revived adds various new historical religions, along with flavour, events, decisions, and titles.

Revive the ancient Egyptian Pantheon and reform the Kingdom of Kemet, or go back to the age of Babylon and worship Mesopotamian gods of Marduk and the Seven Who Decree. Defeat the Jewish lords and prove the dominance of the Canaanite religion as the western Semitic tribes, or conquer the land of the Britons and establish the supremacy of the Arch Druid.
